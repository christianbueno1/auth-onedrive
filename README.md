if you need, given an excel file text.xlsx which you are going to use 2 columns  identified by the headers 'TextHeader1' and 'TextHeader2', use constant variables like TEXT_HEADER1, TEX_HEADERT2 to store the headers values e.g. TEXT_HEADER1 = 'TextHeader1'. This file is created using a Microsoft Form which gather personal information like, address, name, social id card number, phone, email, etc. Another excel file which will be your patterns, this file have some sheets there, you will use the column with header 'PatternHeader' in each sheet as patterns, use a constant variable like PATTERN_HEADER to store the header value, e.g. PATTERN_HEADER = 'PatterHeader'. The idea is find some pattern in the text. It can be the whole phrase but some words too
